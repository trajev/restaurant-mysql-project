# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Management SQL Project

This project contains a sample **Restaurant Management Database** built using **MySQL**. It includes SQL scripts to create tables and insert realistic sample data for managing customers, restaurants, menus, orders, employees, payments, and reviews.  
Also included is an `exercise.sql` file containing **30 real-world SQL problems with their solutions** to help practice and demonstrate query writing skills.

## üìÇ Contents

- `schema.sql` ‚Äî SQL commands to create all tables (`Customer`, `Restaurant`, `Menu`, `Orders`, `Employee`, `Payment_Transaction`, `Customer_Review`)  
- `seed.sql` ‚Äî SQL commands to insert sample data into the tables  
- `exercise.sql` ‚Äî Solved real-world SQL queries based on the database schema (30 examples)  
- `README.md` ‚Äî Project documentation and usage instructions  
- `.gitignore` ‚Äî Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, backup dumps, temp files)

## ‚úÖ Requirements

To run and explore this project, you need the following installed:

- [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) ‚Äì The database engine used in this project  

- A SQL client tool such as:  
  - [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) ‚Äì Free, universal database management tool (recommended)  
  - [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) ‚Äì Official MySQL GUI client  
  - MySQL command-line client (`mysql`) ‚Äì To run `.sql` files using the terminal or shell

> üí° Tip: Use **DBeaver** for managing the database schema visually, executing queries, and exploring results interactively. You can also run all SQL scripts via CLI or MySQL Workbench.

## üöÄ Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-management-mysql.git
   cd restaurant-management-mysql
   ```

2. **Create the database**

   Log into your MySQL server using a client or CLI and create the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE restaurant_db;
   USE restaurant_db;
   ```

3. **Run the schema script to create tables**

   This script (`schema.sql`) creates all the necessary tables: `Customer`, `Restaurant`, `Menu`, `Orders`, `Employee`, `Payment_Transaction`, and `Customer_Review`.

   #### Option A: Using DBeaver
   - Open DBeaver and connect to your MySQL server.
   - Navigate to the `restaurant_db` database.
   - Right-click and select **Tools > Execute script**.
   - Open and run `schema.sql`.

   #### Option B: Using MySQL Workbench
   - Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your server.
   - Open `schema.sql` in the SQL editor.
   - Select your database (`restaurant_db`) and execute the script.

   #### Option C: Using MySQL CLI
   Run the following command in terminal:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p restaurant_db < schema.sql
   ```

4. **Insert sample data**

   Run the `seed.sql` script to populate the tables with sample data.

   - **DBeaver:** Tools > Execute script > select `seed.sql` and run it.
   - **MySQL Workbench:** Open `seed.sql` in the editor and run.
   - **CLI:**

     ```bash
     mysql -u your_username -p restaurant_db < seed.sql
     ```

5. **Practice with real-world queries**

   Use the `exercise.sql` file to test and learn from 30 solved SQL problems based on this schema.

   - **DBeaver / Workbench:** Open `exercise.sql` and run queries one by one.
   - **CLI:** You can also run it via:

     ```bash
     mysql -u your_username -p restaurant_db < exercise.sql
     ```

6. **You're all set!**

   You can now explore, query, and modify the Restaurant Management database.

> üí° **Tip:** Use DBeaver to visualize ER diagrams, browse data, and write queries more interactively.
